# Problem Statement:

Heart Disease is among the most prevalent chronic diseases impacting millions of people around the world. Understanding the complex interplay of factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), physical activity levels, dietary habits, and family history of heart disease is crucial. These variables, among others, collectively contribute to an individual's overall risk profile for cardiovascular events. A holistic approach that considers these variables can provide a more accurate assessment of an individual's heart health and guide personalized interventions to reduce the risk of heart attacks.

By conducting a thorough evaluation of these key variables, healthcare providers can develop targeted interventions and lifestyle modifications to improve heart health and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients. This comprehensive approach is essential for effectively managing heart health and promoting overall well-being.

The tool here developed, provides a preliminary concept to further mature into a reliable assistance for healthcare providers and patients alike to take targeted actions on improving their risk profile.
